  Hi, I'm Jingrui Yu, a researcher and engineer with expertise in 3D vision. Focuses on overcoming challenges in perception and planning for autonomous vehicles and intelligent robots by developing high-quality data-driven models. The ultimate goal is to harness machine intelligence to enhance daily life and industrial production, allowing people to enjoy more leisure time and savor a cup of milk coffee at three in the afternoon.

  #         I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
